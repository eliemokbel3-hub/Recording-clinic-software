# Threat Model (Phases 1–2)

Scope: the implemented system — extension shell, native-messaging host,
registration chain, logging, credential/session-crypto foundations (Phase 1),
plus local recording, encrypted session stores with DPAPI key custody, and
local transcription (Phase 2). Clinical data now exists: audio and
transcripts, encrypted at rest, bounded by a 24-hour recovery window.

## Trust boundaries

1. **Chrome ↔ native host (stdio pipe).**
   - Chrome enforces that only the extension pinned in `allowed_origins`
     (`chrome-extension://mbmhglgadhdohpgbmpbjnaifjagfdfid/`) can launch the
     registered host.
   - The host independently verifies the origin argv and refuses to enter
     protocol mode without it (exit before reading stdin).
   - **The session nonce is a session/correlation identifier, NOT
     authentication.** Any process that can reach the host's stdio already
     sees the nonce in `hello_ack`. It exists to detect mixed/stale sessions
     (wrong-nonce → disconnect), nothing more. No message-level cryptography
     is used on this pipe — deliberately: see "the same-user attacker" below.

2. **The same-user attacker (ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISK).**
   Malware running as the logged-in Windows user owns both endpoints. It can:
   - repoint `HKCU\...\NativeMessagingHosts\com.scribe.cliniko_host` at its
     own binary (registration hijack);
   - replace or edit the host manifest or the installed `scribe-host.exe` in
     `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClinikoScribe\` (both user-writable);
   - modify the venv's interpreter or site-packages (code hijack through the
     host executable);
   - read process memory, including session keys and — in later phases —
     Credential Manager secrets accessible to the user session.
   No extension-side or pipe-side control changes this; message-level crypto
   would be theater against an attacker who owns both endpoints. **Cheap
   tripwire in place:** the host logs its resolved executable, module, cwd,
   registry-resolved manifest path, and the manifest's host-executable path at
   every startup, so a hijacked chain is visible in the log history. **Real
   mitigation** is Phase 7 packaging/signing plus normal OS hygiene
   (up-to-date OS, AV, no untrusted software in the clinic user session).

3. **Extension identity.** The pinned manifest `key` gives ID *stability*,
   not secrecy — for an unpacked extension the public key is visible by
   design. `key.pem` is gitignored; losing it means a new ID and mandatory
   re-registration. The Chrome Web Store will assign a different ID at
   Phase-7 publication (allowed_origins must be updated then).

4. **Protocol robustness (untrusted peer input).** The host treats every
   frame as untrusted: length prefix bounded at 1 MB and rejected WITHOUT
   allocation when oversized, UTF-8/JSON validated, envelope schema enforced
   (unknown fields, explicit nulls, nonce presence rules, version floor),
   typed errors + disconnect on every violation, and broken-pipe-safe writes.
   This is the same posture Phase 3 will need when the *transcript* becomes
   untrusted input to the note model.

## Data-at-rest residual risks

- **Session-key zeroization is best-effort (documented residual, LOW-009).**
  `SessionCrypto.destroy()` zeroes its `bytearray` and drops the reference,
  after which decryption fails — the functional guarantee holds. However,
  immutable `bytes` copies of key material (the `os.urandom` return and the
  per-operation copies handed to the AESGCM object) are freed by Python's
  allocator, not scrubbed; fragments may persist in process memory until
  reuse. Against the same-user attacker this is subsumed by boundary 2; a
  memory-scraping attacker with user privileges wins regardless. Accepted
  for the CPython + `cryptography` stack; revisit only if the threat model
  gains a stronger-than-same-user memory adversary.
- **Log files** contain whitelisted metadata only (structural enforcement +
  tripwire, tested including the pydantic-repr misuse case). Paths logged by
  the startup tripwire are not sensitive.
- **Credential Manager** entries are protected by Windows at user-session
  granularity — same-user access is by design (the host must read keys
  unattended in Phase 4).

## Phase 2: audio, transcripts, and session-key custody

All Phase-2 protections are calibrated to boundary 2 above: the defended
adversary is outside the user's Windows session; the same-user attacker
remains an accepted residual.

1. **DPAPI key custody (crash-recovery window).** Each session's AES-256-GCM
   key is wrapped with `CryptProtectData` (current-user scope, no extra
   entropy) and stored as `sessions\<id>\key.dpapi` while the session is
   active or recoverable (≤ 24 h); it is unwrapped only in memory. Deleting
   that blob IS the cryptographic deletion of the session's audio and
   transcript (deletion ordering: on Complete — fsync transcript, verify a
   decrypt round-trip, THEN delete the key; on Discard — key first, then
   best-effort store removal). Residual: any process in the user's session
   can call `CryptUnprotectData` on the blob while it exists — subsumed by
   boundary 2.
2. **NTFS unlink is not anti-forensic (ACCEPTED RESIDUAL, user decision
   2026-07-26).** `key.dpapi`, `audio.enc`, and `transcript.enc` are removed
   by plain deletion; free clusters, the USN journal, or VSS shadow copies
   may retain the wrapped key blob or ciphertext until overwritten.
   Cryptographic deletion therefore holds at the same-user boundary the
   model already accepts, not against a forensic examiner with the disk.
   No overwrite-before-delete code (weak on NTFS/SSD anyway); full-volume
   encryption (BitLocker) is the real mitigation and is OS hygiene, not app
   scope.
3. **Runtime offline enforcement (primary proof: environment, not
   polling).** The ML stack (silero-VAD ONNX, faster-whisper/CTranslate2)
   loads only explicit local paths with `local_files_only=True`;
   `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1`, `HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`
   are set AND asserted at startup and before every ML import; the
   real-model tests run entirely under the enforced-offline env, and the
   Phase-2 completion gate (plan Step 13) adds a test proving transcription
   succeeds with network stubbed to fail plus socket polling during capture
   and transcription. The idle-app no-sockets polling test already runs,
   but env enforcement is the primary control — short-lived telemetry
   connections can dodge a poll.
   The ONLY sanctioned network user is `scripts/setup-models.py`, a separate
   explicit setup process (SHA-pinned downloads).
4. **Clipboard / same-user UI surface.** The transcript-inspection view is
   display-only (`NoTextInteraction`) so clinical text cannot drift into the
   Windows clipboard (clipboard history / cloud clipboard sync) through
   casual selection. This is cheap defense-in-depth, not a boundary — a
   same-user process can still read process memory (boundary 2).
5. **Single-instance guard (named mutex) — convenience guard, NOT a
   boundary.** A per-user `Global\ClinikoScribe-app-<user>` mutex makes a
   second `scribe-app` show "already running" and exit before it constructs
   a controller or sweep (two instances over one sessions root produced
   real, confusing split-brain state in the 2026-07-28 live smoke). The
   guard fails OPEN on unexpected mutex errors, and a same-user process can
   squat the name — that is a denial-of-convenience inside boundary 2, not
   a data exposure.
6. **24 h recovery cap has sweep-granularity overshoot (ACCEPTED
   RESIDUAL).** The cap is enforced by the startup sweep, a 15-minute
   periodic sweep, and an age filter on the recovery listing; worst-case
   retention overshoot is therefore ≤ ~15 minutes past 24 h while the app
   runs (unbounded only while the app is closed, resolved at next launch —
   the sweep runs before the recovery screen lists anything). Timestamp
   handling is fail-safe: untrusted candidates (non-finite, or beyond the
   clock-skew tolerance in the future) are discarded and can never extend
   retention — age comes from the earliest TRUSTED candidate; if candidates
   exist but none is trusted the store fails CLOSED (expires); if nothing
   is readable at all it is kept and retried next sweep — transient
   filesystem errors must never trigger cryptographic deletion. A bounded
   `CLOCK_SKEW_TOLERANCE` (5 s) accepts mtimes that read marginally ahead
   of `time.time()` — a real effect of Windows' coarse wall clock (~15.6 ms
   on Python ≤ 3.12) against 100 ns NTFS mtimes, which previously made the
   sweep cryptographically delete sessions it had just created. Beyond the
   tolerance a future stamp is still treated as a broken/tampered clock and
   fails closed. Adds ≤ 5 s to the retention overshoot above. The rule is
   defined once (`session_store.earliest_trusted_timestamp`) and shared by the
   sweep and the recovery listing.
7. **Transcript-view availability residual (no custody impact).** The shared
   transcript view can be visually replaced if a live transcription
   finishes while a recovered session's transcript is open; the overwritten
   recovered session remains protected on disk and recoverable after
   restart. Availability-only; Complete/Discard custody ordering is
   unaffected.

## Out of scope for Phases 1–2 (tracked in PLAN.md phases)

Transcript prompt-injection handling at the note model (Phase 3), consent
workflow and recording indicators (Phase 5), the host↔app named pipe
(deferred from Phase 2 to Phase 5 — its consent/command flow is the real
consumer; the locked topology and pipe-hardening notes are recorded in the
Phase 2 plan), OneDrive/backup exclusions and audit records (Phase 6),
packaging/signing (Phase 7).

## Review triggers

Re-review this model when: the named-pipe host↔app channel lands (Phase 5,
deferred from Phase 2); the transcript becomes input to the local note model
(Phase 3); real Cliniko keys are first stored (Phase 4); or the software is
installed on the second clinic machine (Phase 7).
